# DailyDrivingCost
A class assignment to calculate the daily driving cost per day. CIS214.

### What I've learned

Using the order of operation to calculate the variables according to the user's input.

```csharp 
  // Average calculation using the order of operation.
  dailyCost = ((numOfMiles / milesPerGal) * costPerGal + parkFee + tollsPerDay) / 100.0;
```
